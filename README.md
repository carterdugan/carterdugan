# Hi, I'm Carter!

## About me

  I am a student at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I began programming at 14 when I got my first laptop, a Lenovo Yoga 11e Thinkpad (The greatest laptop ever made). My first and favorite langauge is C, followed by C++ and then Python. I also know Java, but I despise it. I believe in open source technology and related philosophies regarding both software and hardware, and am a vocal advocate for the right to repair. Thank you for giving my page a look!
